# Dieselpunk-Volume-Xwidget

A Dieselpunk Volume Control widget, written in Jscript for the XWidget Engine. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10/11+, ReactOS and Mac os/x - Linux with Wine.

This widget is now deprecated and is retained for historical reasons only, it still works but time moves ever onward - please use the VB6 version instead that you will find here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Diesel-Volume-Control-VB6

I created this to be compatible with the Panzer gauges I created for the World of Tanks and War Thunder communities. This dieselpunk widget is a simple Volume Control. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. The graphics are my own, my own original inspiration. 

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

Hovering over any control should supply a pop-up explaining each function.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for windows.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the javascript and creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you provide.

This is based on the older and similar Steampunk Yahoo widget implementation. The graphic interface and operation of the two types of widgets are similar. The only differences are the configuration preference utility (this has a cut-down version), the language is Micrososoft's JScript (rather than javascript) and of course, it is the Xwidget engine that is utilised to put the widget on your screen.

All Jscript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the Jscript and creates the widget 
according to the XML description and using the images you provide.

o Installation of the XWidget runtime engine  

	XWidget engine for Windows - https://www.xwidget.com/download_xwidget.php

Running the widget using a Jscript engine frees Javascript from running only 
within the captivity of a browser o, you will now be able to run these widgets on 
your Windows desktop as long as you have the correct widget engine installed.
