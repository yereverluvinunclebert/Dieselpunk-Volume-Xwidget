A Dieselpunk Volume Control widget. - I created for the World of Tanks and War Thunder communities. This Panzer widget is a simple Volume Control. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. The graphics are my own, I took original inspiration from a clock face by Italo Fortana. 

I took the screenshot photo. It looks like 1944 but it was 2004! The image above 
was shot at Beltring in Kent. I've had to do some serious photoshopping to 
remove any traces of modernity. There were lots. Addition of some grain, 
desaturation and addition of some light brown to give it a hint of old picture. 
I don't want it to look too old as it loses some of the immediacy.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

Hovering over any control should supply a pop-up explaining each function.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for windows.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the javascript and creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you provide.

This is based on the similar Yahoo widget implementation. The graphic interface and operation of the two types of widgets are the same. The only differences are the configuration preference utility (this has a cut-down 
version), the language is Micrososoft's JScript (rather than javascript) and of course, it is the Xwidget engine that is utilised to put the widget on your screen.

All Jscript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the Jscript and creates the widget 
according to the XML description and using the images you provide.
